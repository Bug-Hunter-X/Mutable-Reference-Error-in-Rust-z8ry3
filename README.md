This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving mutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code which panics at runtime. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version using techniques like cloning or  `RefCell` to handle mutable borrows correctly. This example highlights the importance of understanding Rust's borrowing rules to avoid runtime panics.
